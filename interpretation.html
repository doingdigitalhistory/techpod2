    <h1>Sources & Interpretation</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Argument</h2>
      <p>
        The four sources used in this project show that Indian Removal was a deeply unjust and harmful policy in which the United States used its power to take Native homelands, justify forced displacement with misleading language, and ultimately cause devastating suffering for Native communities. Together, these sources prove that Indian Removal was not voluntary, not protective, and not fair—it was a systematic effort to dispossess Native nations and force them from their lands for the benefit of white expansion.

        <h2>Treaty with the Cherokee, 1798</h2>
        <p>
          This treaty pressured the Cherokee to cede land and accept boundaries chosen by the U.S. government. Though framed as a formal agreement, it reflects unequal power and early dispossession, showing that removal pressures began decades before the 1830s.

        <h2>Indian Removal Act (1830)</h2>
        <p>
          The Act claimed removal would be voluntary and beneficial, but in reality gave the President broad authority to push tribes into signing removal treaties. Legal language masked coercion and structural harm.

        <h2>President Andrew Jackson’s Message to Congress (1830)</h2>
        <p>
          Jackson described removal as kind and protective, portraying Native nations as uncivilized and unable to coexist with settlers. His paternalistic rhetoric hid the government’s true motive: gaining land for expansion and settlement.

        <h2>Family Stories from the Trail of Tears</h2>
        <p>
          Oral histories describe Cherokee families being forced from their homes, marching through harsh weather, suffering hunger and disease, and watching loved ones die. These accounts reveal the human toll of removal, proving it was violent and traumatic.
