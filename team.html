          <h2>Mitchell — Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Mitchell, a freshman student at MSU majoring in Actuarial Science. I contributed to this project as the Developer, focusing on using AI to develop the website. My academic interests include math and coding, especially topics connected to statistics and calculus. I chose to work on this project because Indian Removal and displacement represent a major injustice in U.S. history, and I wanted to help present sources that show the harm it caused Native communities. Beyond academics, I am in the MSU Honors College and enjoy creating music and playing video games. This project connected historical sources to modern questions about sovereignty, rights, and how history is told, and I hope readers find the material informative.

          <h2>Dylan Zacks — Researcher</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Dylan Zacks, a second-year student at Michigan State University majoring in Anthropology and Political Science. I contributed as the researcher, focusing on notes that tell a story of exploitation. My academic interests include law, philosophy, and the study of human nature, especially topics connected to sociology. I chose to work on this project because the United States has often exercised power in ways that marginalized Indigenous peoples. Beyond academics, I’m involved in The Sunrise Movement and enjoy playing guitar and video games. This project connected historical sources to modern questions about the exploitation of Indigenous populations by a colonizing force, and I hope readers find the material informative.

          <h2>Abe Iakovides — Researcher & Writer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Abe Iakovides, a first-year student at Michigan State University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I contributed as the researcher and writer, focusing on interpreting the sources, shaping the argument, and helping design the project’s structure. My academic interests include engineering, problem-solving, digital tools, and history, especially how technology and storytelling can together explain complex events. I chose to work on this project because Indian Removal is a major moment in U.S. history that shows how government power, land pressure, and Native resistance shaped the country. Beyond academics, I’m involved in Sigma Chi, enjoy sports, working out, and spending time with friends, and like exploring how AI can support research and learning. I hope readers find the material informative and meaningful.

          <h2>Dante — Editor</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Dante, a second-year student at Michigan State University majoring in Economics and Law. I contributed as the Editor, compiling materials, revising formatting, and producing the README. My academic interests include macroeconomics and law (justice and public policy), especially topics connected to historical inequality, power, and the impact of government decisions. I chose to work on this project because it connects history with justice, policy, and long-term effects of events like removal, sovereignty, and rights. Beyond academics, I’m involved in sports analytics, digital media projects, and entrepreneurial work, and enjoy research, writing, and creative projects. This project connected historical sources to modern questions about rights, power, and sovereignty, and I hope readers find the material informative.
