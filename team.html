          <h2>Mitchell — Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Mitchell, a freshman student at MSU majoring in Actuarial Science. I contributed to this project as the Developer, focusing on using AI to develop the website.
            My academic interests include math and coding, especially topics connected to statistics and calculus. I chose to work on this project because Indian removal and displacement is a major injustice committed by this country, and it has caused indians to die out in the US.
            Beyond academics, I am involved in the MSU Honors College and enjoy creating music with my instruments and playing video games in my free time.
            This project allowed me to connect historical sources to modern questions about sovereignty, rights, and how history is told., and I hope readers find the material informative.

          <h2>Dylan Zacks — Researcher</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Dylan Zacks, a second-year student at Michigan State University majoring in Anthropology and Political Science. I contributed to this project as the researcher, where I focused on taking notes that tell a story of exploitation.
            My academic interests include law, philosophy, and the study of human nature, especially topics connected to sociology. I chose to work on this project because the United States has been a system of oppression, not liberation as it purports.
            Beyond academics, I am involved in The Sunrise Movement, an environmentalist activism group and enjoy playing my guitar and video games.
            This project allowed me to connect historical sources to modern questions about the exploitation of indigenous populations by a colonizing force, and I hope readers find the material informative.

          <h2>Abe Iakovides — Researcher & Writer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Abe Iakovides, a first-year student at Michigan State University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I contributed to this project as the researcher and writer, focusing on interpreting the historical sources, shaping the argument, and helping design the project’s structure.
            My academic interests include engineering, problem-solving, digital tools, and history, especially how technology and storytelling can be used together to explain complex events.
            I chose to work on this project because Indian Removal is a major moment in U.S. history that shows how government power, land pressure, and Native resistance shaped the country, and I wanted to understand that through primary sources.
            Beyond academics, I’m involved in Sigma Chi, enjoy playing sports, working out, and spending time with friends, and like exploring ways AI can support research and learning.
            This project allowed me to connect historical documents to modern questions about sovereignty, rights, and how history is told, and I hope readers find the material informative and meaningful.

          <h2>Dante — Editor</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Dante, a second-year student at Michigan State University majoring in Economics and Law. I contributed to this project as the Editor, where I focused on compiling all the materials, revised formatting, and produced the README.
            My academic interests include macroeconomics and law (justice and public policy), especially topics connected to historical inequality, power, and the impact of government decisions..
            I chose to work on this project because it connects history with justice, policy, and long-term effects of events like removal, sovereignty, and rights.
            Beyond academics, I am involved in sports analytics, digital medial projects, and entrepreneurial work and enjoy research, writing, and creative projects.
            This project allowed me to connect historical sources to modern questions about rights, power, removal, sovereignty, and I hope readers find the material informative.
