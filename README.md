Tech Pod 2 - Rapid Development Challenge

README - Rapid Development Challenge

Project Overview
This project was created for the Rapid Development Challenge in Artificial Intelligence + History. Our group built a small three page digital history project using four primary sources related to Indian Removal. The goal was to make an argument based on these sources and show how AI tools can assist in building historical interpretations quickly.

Tools and AI Used
Microsoft Copilot 
Google Docs (for organizing materials
Google Images / archives (for locating primary source visuals)

Workflow and Roles 
Researcher: Selected and analyzed four primary sources and provided notes
Writer: Created the main interpretation and the historical argument
Developer: Used AI to generate drafts of the three web pages and refined them
Editor: Compiled all materials, revised formatting and produced the README

How to Recreate This Program 
To recreate this project, follow these steps:
Choose a historical topic from the assignment list
Select four related primary sources
Ask an AI tool to generate:
A homepage describing this topic
A sources page that interprets each source and builds an argument 
An authors page with short bios
Edit and refine the AI output so the writing is accurate and consistent
Assemble everything into a single document 
Write a README describing the process (similar to this one)

Purpose of the README:
This README explains the structure of the project, the tools used, and the steps needed to recreate the final product. It demonstrates transparency in how AI assisted with the historical interpretation and digital design process.
