      <h2>What This Project Is About</h2>
      <p>
        This site examines Indian Removal in the early nineteenth century through four
        key sources: an early treaty with the Cherokee, the Indian Removal Act of 1830,
        President Andrew Jackson’s message to Congress, and family stories from the
        Trail of Tears. Together, these sources show how the United States used its
        power to take Native homelands, justify forced migration, and cause deep
        suffering for Native communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to help visitors see how official documents and
        political speeches often hide the human cost of policy decisions, and how
        personal stories reveal the reality behind those words.

          Indian Removal as a long, unjust process of dispossession and forced
          relocation.
