      <h2>About this project</h2>
      <p>
        This site interprets four sources about Indian Removal: the 1798 Treaty with the Cherokee, the 1830 Indian Removal Act, President Andrew Jackson’s message to Congress, and family stories from the Trail of Tears. Together, they show how federal power, legal language, and political rhetoric were used to dispossess Native nations and force them from homelands, while lived experiences reveal the devastating human consequences. The goal is to put legal text and official justification side by side with community memory and suffering, so the policy’s reality becomes unmistakable.

      <h2>What the sources reveal</h2>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li><strong>Early pressure:</strong> The 1798 treaty shows cession, boundary marking, and federal control framed as “protection,” reflecting unequal power and land loss decades before the 1830s.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal authority:</strong> The 1830 Act granted broad presidential power and presented removal as an exchange and aid, masking coercion behind procedural and benevolent language.</li>
        <li><strong>Rhetorical cover:</strong> Jackson’s message celebrates removal as “benevolent,” linking it to state growth and frontier security while othering Native peoples and prioritizing white expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Human cost:</strong> Family stories document forced marches, exposure, hunger, disease, and death, showing removal was traumatic and deadly, not voluntary or protective.</li>
      </ul>
